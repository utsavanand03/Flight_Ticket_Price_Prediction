# Flight_Ticket_Price_Prediction
Flight ticket price prediction is a complex task that involves analyzing a variety of factors, such as the airline, the date of travel, the source and destination airports, and the time of day. Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict flight ticket prices with a high degree of accuracy. This information can be used by travelers to find the best deals on flights.

Here are some of the factors that can affect flight ticket prices:

**Airline:** Different airlines have different pricing strategies. Some airlines may charge more for flights during peak travel times, while others may offer discounts.
**Date of travel:** Flight prices tend to be higher during peak travel times, such as holidays and school breaks.
****Source and destination airports**:** Flight prices can vary depending on the airports involved in the journey. For example, flights from major airports to smaller airports are often cheaper.
**Time of day:** Flight prices can also vary depending on the time of day. Flights that depart early in the morning or late at night are often cheaper than flights that depart during the day.
Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze these factors and predict flight ticket prices with a high degree of accuracy. This information can be used by travelers to find the best deals on flights.
